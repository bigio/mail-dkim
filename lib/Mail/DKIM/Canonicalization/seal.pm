# This canonicalization is for the ARC-Seal header from
# https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-dmarc-arc-protocol-06
# Rather than having a 'h' property, it processes the headers in
# a pre-defined way.
#
# 5.1.1.3.  Deterministic (Implicit) 'h' Tag Value for ARC-Seal
#
#   In this section, the term "scope" is used to indicate those header
#   fields signed by an ARC-Seal header field.  A number in parentheses
#   indicates the instance of that field, starting at 1.  The suffix "-
#   no-b" is used with an ARC-Seal field to indicate that its "b" field
#   is empty at the time the signature is computed, as described in
#   Section 3.5 of [RFC6376].  "AAR" refers to ARC-Authentication-
#   Results, "AMS" to ARC-Message-Signature, "AS" to ARC-Seal, and "ASB"
#   to an ARC-Seal with an empty "b" tag.
#
#   Generally, the scope of an ARC set for a message containing "n" ARC
#   sets is the concatenation of the following, for x (instance number)
#   from 1 to n:
#
#   o  AAR(x);
#
#   o  AMS(x);
#
#   o  ASB(x) if x = n, else AS(x)
#
#   Thus for a message with no seals (i.e., upon injection), the scope of
#   the first ARC set is AAR(1):AMS(1):ASB(1).  The ARC set thus
#   generated would produce a first ARC-Seal with a "b" value.  The next
#   ARC set would include in its signed content the prior scope, so it
#   would have a scope of AAR(1):AMS(1):AS(1):AAR(2):AMS(2):ASB(2).
#
#   Note: Typically header field sets appear within the header in
#   descending instance order.
